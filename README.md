# How to run

if you're using the command line you can input this, assuming you have scala installed on your machine:
E.G:

    $ scala OrderAnalyzerApp 2021-01-01 2022-02-01

you can alter the date interval for testing as you wish

If you're running on an IDE such as IntellJ, you must find the Run/Debug Configurations windows and input the program arguments
